# CRUD- Web Application with Access Database File.

This is my project which contains the logic of a system that has login and information about its users. It shows how CRUD
(Create, Retrieve, Update,Delete) works together and how it is implemented for Web.I use Local Database File to keep my data. 
I put the .accdb database file in the folder App_Data, which you will find in my project,so you do not have to make any changes
or anything else to use it on your machine. You are able to load it on Visual Studio (which of course has Web),press F5 and 
look at how it works. I used ASP.NET Web Forms Application (not empty), so I put templates ready for use and then correct them 
with .css file.
